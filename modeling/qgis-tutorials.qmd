## Common Software 

Shell â€” any command line environment will do for the exercises. For Linux we recommend the [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) shell. For Windows the Windows command line can be used.

* [QGIS](HTTP://www.qgis.org/de/docs/user_manual/index.html#qgis-manual-index-reference) has become one of the most promising and most integrative open source GIS systems over the last years. Through the processing plugin, it additionally integrates modules from the other leading free GIS solutions. We will need it (if necessary) to prepare or manipulate some of the data.

Regarding installation, for Ubuntu Linux, the [Ubuntu GIS package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS) is a good choice. For Windows, we strongly recommend installing everything via the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) environment and not the standalone QGIS installation tool.
