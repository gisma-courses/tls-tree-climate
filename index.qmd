## This course explores how trees shape climate – through structure, species, and energy flow. You’ll work with laser scans, land data, and physical models to reveal patterns beneath the canopy

### What you’ll do:

 -  Evaluate atmosphere–vegetation models and their structure feedbacks
 -  Analyze surface energy fluxes to understand vertical climate profiles
 -  Extract tree structure from TLS and ALS point clouds
 -  Classify and correct species distributions
 -  Transform OSM maps into simulation-ready domains
