<p><strong>This course explores how trees shape climate – through structure, species, and energy flow. You’ll work with laser scans, land data, and physical models to reveal patterns beneath the canopy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluate atmosphere–vegetation models and their structure feedbacks</li>
  <li>Analyze surface energy fluxes to understand vertical climate profiles</li>
  <li>Extract tree structure from TLS and ALS point clouds</li>
  <li>Classify and correct species distributions</li>
  <li>Transform OSM maps into simulation-ready domains</li>
</ul>
