The arguments of the citizens' initiative *wirsindhasenkopf* include the following:

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
*"The city of Marburg declared a climate emergency in 2019. The rapidly advancing climate change should lead to open spaces like the Hasenkopf not being sealed over, thus enabling them to retain their function as a cold air production area."*
:::

## Goals

The function of the planned development area as a cold air production area is to be examined quantitatively and in situ by means of a physical modeling. For this purpose, there is an initial site inspection and a step-by-step introduction to the necessary data and techniques.

## Things you need

-   Weatherproof and all-terrain clothing

## Assignment

-   Create an initial sketch on paper that describes the terrain and special spatial features.
-   Digitize this rough sketch with the help of an aerial image database in three classes: arable land , grassland, bushes/trees.
-   Import these Shapefiles into Monde and assign class 0200LG from the Envi-met DB Manager for arable land, 0200LG for grassland and 0200LG for bushes/trees.
-   Run a complete standard simulation with these values using your knowledge from the first tutorial.l
