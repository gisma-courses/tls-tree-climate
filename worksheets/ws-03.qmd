## Goals 

Now that the first steps have been taken - namely, the technical and simple hasenkopf example simulations and a rough structuring of the research questions - it is necessary to design a concrete approach.




## Things you need

* [Course Data Server](https://hessenbox.uni-marburg.de/getlink/fi5p6EzMUrtUVFW3DnkFky/envimet) You will find here all kinds of data, literature and tutorials 
* [ENVI-met software](https://envi-met.info/doku.php?id=start)
* Please have a look at the **Monde Tutorial videos**
* QGIS

## Assignment
Design a concrete modeling approach and a suitable associated modeling concept to assess the performance of Envimet to simulate how are the effects of the Hasenkopf build up plans affecting the fresh air support of Marburg.  

Consider the following aspects:

* abiotic endowment of the model domain (relief, soil, site location).
* biotic features of the model domain (simple/3D vegetation)
* appropriate meteorology for model initialization (ideal, real values)
* technical model domain (x,y,z extent, time steps nesting)
* Validation strategy

Design the necessary work packages you need to divide your team into groups/single workers to achieve the goal.

 * WP 1 data aquisition (DEM/DSM, vegetation, soil, build up areas, planned hasenkopf build up area, meteo data )
 * WP 2 data manipulation using QGIS 
   - WP 2a Vegetation "simple
   - WP 2b Vegetation "3D
   - WP 2c buildings
   - WP 2d Terrain, soil etc.
 * WP 3 Meteorological data
 * WP 4 Model Setup
 * WP 6 Simulation
 * WP 7 Presentation
 
 
The task is then as follows:

The resulting concept should be prepared as a table (similar to the below example), also addressing the literature/data  used as well as know shortcomings.

### Assignment 1

From your knowledge now prepare a table containing the following information 

| ressources needed | solution | references | needs manipulation | knowledge available | Who is doing it |
|:-------:|:--------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| relief | 1 m DOM |  download link etc. | yes, what kind of | no, what aditional knowledge do you need | Name(s) |
| soil properties | soil data  | access has to be clarified |  who knows| ? | ? |
| soil vertical structure | four levels temperature soil moisture build-in model| envi-met | ? | ? | ? |
|... |... |... |... |... |... |


Any written notes please put them on `comments` below. 

### Assignment 2

Identify the critical shortcomings to solve these problems. State them clearly and try to offer a solution.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}

It is very important to understand what needs to be done and in which order by looking at the previous sessions and the tutorial. 

The focus is on identifying the required data, the appropriate data preparation (also think about 3D problems!) and the standard initialisation of Envimet.
