October 2021\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nWith the following data protection declaration, we would like to inform you about the types of your personal data (hereinafter also referred to as “data” for short) that we process, for what purposes and to what extent. The privacy policy applies to all processing of personal data carried out by us, both in the context of the provision of our services and in particular on our websites, in mobile applications and within external online presences, such as our social media profiles (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Online Offerings”).\n\n\nThe terms used are not gender-specific.\n\n\nResponsible\n\n\nDr Christoph ReudenbachDeutschhaustr 1035037 Marburg\n\n\nEmail address: reudenbach@uni-marburg.de.\n\n\nImprint: https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/impressum.\n\n\nOverview of Processing\n\n\nThe following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing, and refers to the data subjects.\n\n\nTypes of Data Processed\n\n\n\nContent data (e.g. input in online forms).\n\n\nContact data (e.g. email, phone numbers).\n\n\nMeta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nUse data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).\n\n\n\nCategories of data subjects\n\n\n\nCommunication partners.\n\n\nUsers (e.g.. Website visitors, users of online services).\n\n\n\nPurposes of processing\n\n\n\nDirect marketing (e.g., by email or postal mail).\n\n\nContact requests and communications.\n\n\n\nRelevant legal basis\n\n\nThe following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be decisive in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.\n\n \n\n\nConsent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO) - The data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for a specific purpose or purposes.\n\n\nRegistered interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.\n\n\n\nNational data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.\n\n \n\nSecurity measures\n\n\nWe take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.\n\n.\n\nMeasures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to data as well as access to, entry into, disclosure of, assurance of availability of, and segregation of data concerning them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects’ rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.\n\n \n\nDeletion of data\n\n\nThe data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not necessary for the purpose).\n\n \n\nIf the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. That is, the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural person or legal entity.\n\n \n\nOur privacy notices may also include further information on the retention and deletion of data that takes precedence for the processing operations in question.\n\n \n\nUse of cookies\n\n\nCookies are text files that contain data from websites or domains visited and are stored by a browser on the user’s computer. The primary purpose of a cookie is to store information about a user during or after their visit within an online site. Stored information may include, for example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart, or where a video was watched. We further include in the term cookies other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user details are stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as “user IDs”)\n\n.\n\nThe following cookie types and functions are distinguished:\n\n\n\nTemporary cookies (also: session or session cookies): Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.\n\n\nPermanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. Likewise, the interests of users used for range measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.\n\n\nFirst-party cookies: First-party cookies are set by ourselves.\n\n\nThird-party cookies (also: third-party cookies): Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.\n\n\nNecessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies: Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).\n\n\nStatistics, marketing and personalization cookies: Furthermore, cookies are usually also used in the context of range measurement and when the interests of a user or his behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, use of functions, etc.) on individual web pages are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as “tracking”, i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.\n\n\n\nNotes on legal bases: On which legal basis we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.\n\n.\n\nDuration of storage: If we do not provide you with explicit information about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. in the context of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.\n\n.\n\nGeneral information on revocation and objection (opt-out):  Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as “opt-out”). You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality of our online offer). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/. In addition, you can receive further objection notices in the context of the information on the service providers and cookies used.\n\n.\n\nProcessing of cookie data on the basis of consent: We use a cookie consent management procedure, in the context of which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. Here, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its query and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. Here, a pseudonymous user identifier is formed and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and end device used.\n\n.\n\n\nTypes of data processed: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nPersons concerned: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\n\nLegal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).\n\n\n\nSurveys and polls\n\n\nThe surveys and polls (hereinafter “surveys”) conducted by us are evaluated anonymously. Personal data is only processed insofar as this is necessary for the provision and technical implementation of the surveys (e.g. processing of the IP address to display the survey in the user’s browser or to enable a resumption of the survey with the help of a temporary cookie (session cookie)) or users have consented.\n\n.\n\nNotes on legal basis: If we ask participants for consent to process their data, this is the legal basis of the processing, otherwise the processing of participants’ data is based on our legitimate interests in conducting an objective survey.\n\n \n\n\nTypes of data processed: Contact data (e.g. email, phone numbers), content data (e.g. input in online forms), usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nParticipants concerned: Communication partners.\n\n\nPurposes of processing: Contact requests and communication, direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or postal mail).\n\n\nLegal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).\n\n\n\nChange and Update Privacy Policy\n\n\nWe encourage you to periodically review the contents of our Privacy Policy. We adapt the Privacy Policy as soon as the changes in the data processing activities we carry out make it necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.\n\n.\n\nWhere we provide addresses and contact information for companies and organizations in this Privacy Policy, please note that addresses may change over time and please check the information before contacting us.\n\n.\n\nRights of data subjects\n\n\nAs a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 DSGVO:\n\n\n\nRight to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing.\n\n\nRight of withdrawal in the case of consent: You have the right to withdraw any consent you have given at any time.\n\n\nRight of access: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether data in question is being processed and to information about this data, as well as further information and copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.\n\n\nRight of rectification: You have the right, in accordance with the legal requirements, to request the completion of the data concerning you or the correction of incorrect data concerning you.\n\n\nRight to erasure and restriction of processing: You have, in accordance with the law, the right to request that data concerning you be erased without undue delay, or alternatively, in accordance with the law, to request restriction of the processing of the data.\n\n\nRight to data portability: You have the right to receive data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, common and machine-readable format in accordance with the legal requirements, or to demand its transfer to another responsible party.\n\n\nComplaint to supervisory authority: Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the requirements of the GDPR.\n\n\n.\n\nDefinitions of Terms\n\n\nThis section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this Privacy Policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Article 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.\n\n \n\n\nPersonal data: “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (eg. e.g. cookie) or to one or more special characteristics that are an expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\n\nController: The “controller” is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n\n\nProcessing: “Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and includes virtually any handling of data, whether collecting, evaluating, storing, transmitting or deleting.\n\n\n\nCreated with free Datenschutz-Generator.de by Dr. Thomas Schwenke"

Models differ considerably in their structure, focus, technical maturity, and accessibility. What does this mean? Some models achieve excellent physical accuracy (e.g., LES-based turbulence and complete feedback between plants and the atmosphere) but require in-depth technical knowledge or high-performance computers. Other models, on the other hand, sacrifice physical completeness in favor of practicality and easy integration into planning or monitoring processes.\nOur attempt is to enable this multi-criteria assessment and make it comprehensible by means of an evaluation framework in order to arrive at a pre-selection. This is done by combining quantitative assessments with a qualitative classification system, in particular:\n\nscientific completeness based on various categories\noperational usability\n\nThe evaluation is based on clearly defined criteria such as model physics, plant physiology, plant structure, model dimensionality and scales, and user-friendliness. However, the relative weights reflect value-based assessments – what is considered more important depends on the context (urban planning vs. ecohydrology vs. forest micrometeorology). In concrete terms, this means:\n\nIn urban planning, user-friendliness and realistic 3D air flows may be paramount.\nIn plant science, biophysics and physiology may be paramount.\nIn forestry, compatibility with TLS or QSM inputs may be required.\n\nThis is not a weakness, but a strength, as it allows adaptation to the user’s goals – as long as the weighting and criteria are transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nSub-Capabilities / Description\nScoring Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n3.0\nLES/RANS, radiative transfer, soil–vegetation coupling\n1.5–3.0: Full LES or RANS / radiation / soil 0.6–1.4: Partial (e.g., radiation only) &lt; 0.6: Basic or missing physics\n\n\nStructure\n1.0\nRealistic vegetation structure (e.g., QSM/LAD, voxel, TLS-derived)\n0.8–1.0: Full 3D voxel/QSM/tree geometry 0.4–0.7: Schematic trees &lt; 0.4: No or empirical structure\n\n\nFeedback\n1.0\nBiophysical feedback transpiration ↔︎ air\n0.8–1.0: Full coupling 0.4–0.7: Drag or partial interaction &lt; 0.4: One-way/static\n\n\nPhysiology\n1.0\nTranspiration, photosynthesis, stomata, water flow\n0.8–1.0: Full physiology 0.4–0.7: Simplified &lt; 0.4: None\n\n\nUsability\n2.0\nGUI/CLI, documentation, install, license, hardware\n1.5–2.0: Documented, user-friendly 0.6–1.4: CLI/complex &lt; 0.6: Legacy/unusable\n\n\n3D\n2.0\nFull 3D resolution and within-canopy gradients\n1.0–1.9: Full 3D 0.6–0.9: Pseudo-3D 0.3–0.5: Layered &lt; 0.3: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroscale applicable models can resolve processes on spatial scales of ≤ 10 m. At this scale, air flows, radiation, and microclimate dynamics become relevant at the tree level. These models are typically characterized by the following features:\n\nThey work with high-resolution 3D grids.\nVegetation is explicitly represented (e.g., voxel- or TLS-based).\nLocalized simulations of plots, tree groups, or urban areas are possible.\n\nMicroscale capability is essential for LiDAR-based modeling, urban forestry, and the investigation of microclimates in tree canopies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMicroscale Capability Description\n\n\n\n\n✅\nFully applicable: Designed for a resolution of ≤ 10 m with 3D vegetation–atmosphere coupling.\n\n\n🟨\nConditionally applicable: Partial support for high resolutions, but limited physics or geometry.\n\n\n❌\nNot applicable: Coarse resolution or missing spatial details.\n\n\n\n\nThe following characteristics are flagged with an ❌ for experimental or obsolete models:\n\nno longer maintained or widely used.\nthey were developed for niche applications or obsolete use cases.\nthere is a complete lack of user-friendly workflows or adequate documentation.\n\nThis leads to the following classification scheme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nLabel\nImplied Score\nExplanation of the Classification\n\n\n\n\n🟩\nHigh capability, high usability\n7.0–10.0\nFully featured and deployable with reasonable effort (GUI, docs, user base)\n\n\n🟧\nHigh capability, low usability\n7.0–10.0\nPowerful but difficult to use; expert-only setup, low maturity\n\n\n🟦\nModerate capability, well-integrated\n5.0–6.9\nSolid for many tasks; lacks advanced coupling but usable and balanced\n\n\n🟨\nSpecialized model, high usability\n4.0–6.9\nLimited scope (e.g. radiation only), but very accessible and documented\n\n\n🟥\nExperimental or niche\n4.0–6.9\nLimited audience or non-generalizable application\n\n\n❌\nLegacy/unmaintained/ not usable\nany\nNo active development or practical use case today\n\n\n\n\nNote: This classification does not always correspond to the ranking by score, which is intentional. For example, a model with a high score may still be marked with 🟧 or ❌ if it is technically difficult to implement, is not documented or maintained, or is simply no longer available. This helps to put the pure scoring performance into perspective, which would otherwise lead to the selection of models that prove to be unusable in practice.\n\n\n\n\nFifteen models were systematically evaluated based on the assessment framework presented above. The models were selected on an exploratory basis using Google searches, specialist literature (e.g., GMD Geoscientific Model Development, ScienceDirect), well-known model comparisons, and open-source repositories. The selection is therefore well-founded but not entirely systematic. The following tables shows the results of this evaluation. It not only shows the weighted overall score, but also differentiates between the underlying individual criteria. In addition, the applicability in the microscale range is indicated and each model is classified using a color-coded classification system. This makes the performance of a model in terms of the atmosphere-vegetation coupling transparent and shows the extent to which a model can be realistically integrated into scientific or operational processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nScore\nAtmosphere Physics\nStructure\nFeedback\nPhysiology\nUsability\n3D\nMicroscale Capabilities\nAll\nMicroScale\n\n\n\n\n1\nPALM-4U\n7.6\n1.0Full LES and radiative transfer;

The inverse relationship reflects a common trade-off: high-performing models (right) often require expert-level setup (low usability, bottom), while user-friendly models (top) tend to be simplified. Colored points reflect model classification: 🟩 usable and capable, 🟧 powerful but complex, 🟦 balanced, 🟨 specialized, and 🟥 experimental. Models above the trend line (e.g., ENVI-met) offer better usability than expected for their score; those below (e.g., MuSICA) require disproportionately high effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we narrow the selection by removing models that are either classified as legacy systems (❌ ) or that lack both microscale applicability (❌) and fully resolved 3D spatial representation (&lt;1.0), the set of viable modeling platforms is drastically reduced. This filtering excludes tools that are either outdated, lack dimensional realism, or are designed for coarse-scale applications incompatible with high-resolution vegetation–atmosphere modeling. What remains is a focused set of platforms that combine scientific robustness with operational feasibility for modeling processes at the tree or plot level. These remaining models offer realistic support for implementation in urban microclimate design, LiDAR-informed ecological studies, and vegetation-based climate adaptation strategies where 3D feedbacks and spatial structure matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nModel\nScore\nAtmosphere\nStructure\nFeedback\nPhysiology\nUsability\n3D\nAll\nMicroScale\n\n\n\n\n1\nPALM-4U\n7.6\n1.0 – Full LES, radiation, no soil\n0.8 – Static vegetation models\n0.7 – Basic interaction\n0.3 – No physiology\n0.4 – Complex setup, Linux only, docs\n1.0 – True 3D\n🟧\n🟩\n\n\n2\nOpenFOAM\n7.3\n2.5 – Full LES/RANS, partial radiation\n1.0 – Porosity/drag approach\n0.5 – Feedback via coding\n0.0 – None\n0.2 – CLI, expert only\n1.9 – Full CFD\n🟧\n🟩\n\n\n3\nENVI-met\n6.9\n0.8 – RANS, radiation\n0.6 – Block trees only\n0.4 – Weak one-way coupling\n0.3 – Simplified transpiration\n0.6 – GUI, docs, runs on PC\n1.0 – Pseudo-3D layering\n🟩\n🟩\n\n\n4\nWRF-Urban\n6.5\n0.9 – RANS, radiation\n0.7 – Layered urban/vegetation\n0.6 – Bulk interaction\n0.2 – None\n0.3 – HPC, not easily usable\n1.0 – Grid-based\n🟧\n🟨\n\n\n5\nMicroclimc\n4.2\n0.6 – Radiation and temp model, no LES\n0.3 – Schematic trees\n0.4 – Indirect surface coupling\n0.4 – Empirical transpiration\n0.8 – GUI, documentation, R integration\n0.5 – Semi-3D canopy layer\n🟨\n🟨\n\n\n\nSorting applied:\nPrimary: Microscale applicability (✅ &gt; 🟨 &gt; ❌)\nSecondary: Total Score (descending)\n\n\n\n\n\nto be completed\nENVI-met\n\nBruse, M., & Fleer, H.

In concrete terms, this means:\n\nIn urban planning, user-friendliness and realistic 3D air flows may be paramount.\nIn plant science, biophysics and physiology may be paramount.\nIn forestry, compatibility with TLS or QSM inputs may be required.\n\nThis is not a weakness, but a strength, as it allows adaptation to the user’s goals – as long as the weighting and criteria are transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nSub-Capabilities / Description\nScoring Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n3.0\nLES/RANS, radiative transfer, soil–vegetation coupling\n1.5–3.0: Full LES or RANS / radiation / soil 0.6–1.4: Partial (e.g., radiation only) &lt; 0.6: Basic or missing physics\n\n\nStructure\n1.0\nRealistic vegetation structure (e.g., QSM/LAD, voxel, TLS-derived)\n0.8–1.0: Full 3D voxel/QSM/tree geometry 0.4–0.7: Schematic trees &lt; 0.4: No or empirical structure\n\n\nFeedback\n1.0\nBiophysical feedback transpiration ↔︎ air\n0.8–1.0: Full coupling 0.4–0.7: Drag or partial interaction &lt; 0.4: One-way/static\n\n\nPhysiology\n1.0\nTranspiration, photosynthesis, stomata, water flow\n0.8–1.0: Full physiology 0.4–0.7: Simplified &lt; 0.4: None\n\n\nUsability\n2.0\nGUI/CLI, documentation, install, license, hardware\n1.5–2.0: Documented, user-friendly 0.6–1.4: CLI/complex &lt; 0.6: Legacy/unusable\n\n\n3D\n2.0\nFull 3D resolution and within-canopy gradients\n1.0–1.9: Full 3D 0.6–0.9: Pseudo-3D 0.3–0.5: Layered &lt; 0.3: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroscale applicable models can resolve processes on spatial scales of ≤ 10 m. At this scale, air flows, radiation, and microclimate dynamics become relevant at the tree level. These models are typically characterized by the following features:\n\nThey work with high-resolution 3D grids.\nVegetation is explicitly represented (e.g., voxel- or TLS-based).\nLocalized simulations of plots, tree groups, or urban areas are possible.\n\nMicroscale capability is essential for LiDAR-based modeling, urban forestry, and the investigation of microclimates in tree canopies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMicroscale Capability Description\n\n\n\n\n✅\nFully applicable: Designed for a resolution of ≤ 10 m with 3D vegetation–atmosphere coupling.\n\n\n🟨\nConditionally applicable: Partial support for high resolutions, but limited physics or geometry.\n\n\n❌\nNot applicable: Coarse resolution or missing spatial details.\n\n\n\n\nThe following characteristics are flagged with an ❌ for experimental or obsolete models:\n\nno longer maintained or widely used.\nthey were developed for niche applications or obsolete use cases.\nthere is a complete lack of user-friendly workflows or adequate documentation.\n\nThis leads to the following classification scheme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nLabel\nImplied Score\nExplanation of the Classification\n\n\n\n\n🟩\nHigh capability, high usability\n7.0–10.0\nFully featured and deployable with reasonable effort (GUI, docs, user base)\n\n\n🟧\nHigh capability, low usability\n7.0–10.0\nPowerful but difficult to use; expert-only setup, low maturity\n\n\n🟦\nModerate capability, well-integrated\n5.0–6.9\nSolid for many tasks; lacks advanced coupling but usable and balanced\n\n\n🟨\nSpecialized model, high usability\n4.0–6.9\nLimited scope (e.g. radiation only), but very accessible and documented\n\n\n🟥\nExperimental or niche\n4.0–6.9\nLimited audience or non-generalizable application\n\n\n❌\nLegacy/unmaintained/ not usable\nany\nNo active development or practical use case today\n\n\n\n\nNote: This classification does not always correspond to the ranking by score, which is intentional. For example, a model with a high score may still be marked with 🟧 or ❌ if it is technically difficult to implement, is not documented or maintained, or is simply no longer available. This helps to put the pure scoring performance into perspective, which would otherwise lead to the selection of models that prove to be unusable in practice.",

This filtering excludes tools that are either outdated, lack dimensional realism, or are designed for coarse-scale applications incompatible with high-resolution vegetation–atmosphere modeling. What remains is a focused set of platforms that combine scientific robustness with operational feasibility for modeling processes at the tree or plot level. These remaining models offer realistic support for implementation in urban microclimate design, LiDAR-informed ecological studies, and vegetation-based climate adaptation strategies where 3D feedbacks and spatial structure matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nModel\nScore\nAtmosphere\nStructure\nFeedback\nPhysiology\nUsability\n3D\nAll\nMicroScale\n\n\n\n\n1\nPALM-4U\n7.6\n1.0 – Full LES, radiation, no soil\n0.8 – Static vegetation models\n0.7 – Basic interaction\n0.3 – No physiology\n0.4 – Complex setup, Linux only, docs\n1.0 – True 3D\n🟧\n🟩\n\n\n2\nOpenFOAM\n7.3\n2.5 – Full LES/RANS, partial radiation\n1.0 – Porosity/drag approach\n0.5 – Feedback via coding\n0.0 – None\n0.2 – CLI, expert only\n1.9 – Full CFD\n🟧\n🟩\n\n\n3\nENVI-met\n6.9\n0.8 – RANS, radiation\n0.6 – Block trees only\n0.4 – Weak one-way coupling\n0.3 – Simplified transpiration\n0.6 – GUI, docs, runs on PC\n1.0 – Pseudo-3D layering\n🟩\n🟩\n\n\n4\nWRF-Urban\n6.5\n0.9 – RANS, radiation\n0.7 – Layered urban/vegetation\n0.6 – Bulk interaction\n0.2 – None\n0.3 – HPC, not easily usable\n1.0 – Grid-based\n🟧\n🟨\n\n\n5\nMicroclimc\n4.2\n0.6 – Radiation and temp model, no LES\n0.3 – Schematic trees\n0.4 – Indirect surface coupling\n0.4 – Empirical transpiration\n0.8 – GUI, documentation, R integration\n0.5 – Semi-3D canopy layer\n🟨\n🟨\n\n\n\nSorting applied:\nPrimary: Microscale applicability (✅ &gt; 🟨 &gt; ❌)\nSecondary: Total Score (descending)",

    "text": "Hands on\nThe preparation of the modelling environment for an Envi_met model run can be as complex as desired, but the following criteria should always be kept in mind:\n\nthe size and desired resolution of the model domain (depending on the research question AND computing costs)\nscientific or planning level of detail of the research question\nfocus of the modelling (wind field, plant respiration, micrometeorological parameters).\n\nThe input data sources must be selected according to these factors. In hilly terrain, a high resolution digital terrain model or digital surface model is essential. In addition, at least a rough estimate of land use and soil type is required. In addition the three-dimensional structure of the model requires at least good estimates of vegetation and building heights in the selected model area.\nFor the modeling of cold air drainage (i.e. fresh air production) in the Hasenkopf area, the terrain, land use and meteorologically critical situations are of central importance. If you do not want to collect all the data in the field manually (which may be a sensible approach), Open Street Map data and aerial images are particularly useful for land use and possible follow-up surveys. Terrain data is now available in high resolution in the 1m range for large parts of Europe and the world. This data must be downloaded and prepared accordingly (for the Envi_met logic). There is now a powerful and largely functional plugin for QGIS ‘Geodata to Envi_met’, which intuitively specifies how this data is to be organized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the above question of cold air production, the freely available data from the State of Hesse and the Hessian Administration for Land Management and Geoinformation, as well as the Openstreetmap data, are well suited. In addition, some planning maps have to be digitised manually.\n\n\n\n\nDownload of the data\n\nDigital Elevation Model DEM and Digital Surface Model DSM files relevant for Marburg can be downloaded from the GDS website of the Hessian Administration for Land Management and Geoinformation\nFor downloading the OSM data it is recommended to use the OSMDownloader extension to QGIS. It simply provides the ability to draw a rectangle and download the complete and currently available OSM data to a file named hasenkopf.osm.\nIf the data has to be digitised manually, it is advisable to use an up-to-date aerial photograph from Bing or Google. These can be easily integrated via XYZ tiles\nThe planning data for the development and sealing were taken from page 23 of the presentation of the winning design via screenshot."

This is done very simply as follows: Open the vegtypes.gpkg attribute table and then the field calculator. Create a new field with 6 alphanumeric characters and the name ENVIMET_ID. Then process the following expression. This assigns the corresponding vegetation database identifier to the new ‘ENVIMET_ID’ field.\nCASE \nCASE \n  WHEN \"landuse\" =   'grass'       THEN '000000'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'meadow'        THEN '000000'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmyard'      THEN '0201H4'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'forest'        THEN '0000SM'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'allotments'    THEN '0201H4'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'orchard'       THEN '000051'\n  WHEN \"natural\" =   'grassland'     THEN '000000'  \n  WHEN \"natural\" =   'wood'          THEN '0000SM'\n    WHEN \"natural\" =   'scrub'         THEN '0100H2'  \n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmland'      THEN '02AGSS'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'residental'    THEN '02AGSS'    \n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'industrial'    THEN '0200AK'    \n    ELSE '000000'\nEND\n\nSave the file.\nOn the same file, we need to edit the non-vegetated surfaces in a corresponding way:\nCASE \n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmland'      THEN '02AGSS'\n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'residental'    THEN '02AGSS'    \n    WHEN \"landuse\" =   'industrial'    THEN '0200AK'\n  ELSE '0200AK'\nPress Select Objects Button and Export selected Values only (do not forget to assign the correct projection EPSG:32632) and name it polygons_surfaces.gpkg.\n\n\nLine surface types\nWe need polygon data for the spatial setup of the envimet model domain. Line data is one-dimensional, so a simple approach is to buffer roads according to their priority. Therefore we buffer the different road types with 8m (primary), 5m (secondary), 4m (tertiary) and 2.5m (tracks).\nThen process the following expression to assign the ENVIMET_IDs:\n\nCASE \n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'primary'        THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'primary_link'   THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'secondary'      THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'secondary_link' THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'tertiary'       THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'tertiary_link'  THEN '0200AK'  \n  WHEN \"surface\" =   'asphalt'        THEN '0200AK'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'ground'         THEN '0200TS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'dirt'           THEN '0200TS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'mud'            THEN '0200TS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'fine_gravel'    THEN '0200BS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'gravel'         THEN '0200BS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'grass'          THEN '02AGSS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'unpaved'        THEN '0200TS'\n    WHEN \"surface\" =   'compacted'      THEN '0200BS'\nELSE '0200TS'\nEND\nSave the file as line_surfaces.gpgk.\nNext merge polygons_surfaces.gpkg and line_surface.gpgk into all_surfaces.gpgk."

All streets and sealed surfaces should be present here, but the surfaces under vegetation, etc. have no information. The easiest way is to assign a soil type code to this total area. This is most easily done by calculating a symmetric difference between the surface data and the model area; the resulting polygon is a negative of the existing surfaces. This polygon is then assigned a field ‘ENVIMET_ID’ and the corresponding soil value is entered. The file is then merged with the existing surface file (merge tool).\nRegarding 2: If areas are unclear, they must be digitized manual. To do this, open the Bing/Google aerial map and open the corresponding vegetation file, make it editable and re-digitize it. It is important that the correct ENVIMET_ID is assigned at the end of each polygon.\nRegarding 3: Simply compare the aerial image to see if all buildings are present in the model area. If not, digitize them again and then use the zonal statistics tool again."

    "text": "Microclimates, or small-scale local atmospheric conditions, play a critical role in ecosystems, human activities, and environmental processes of all kinds. Microclimates are defined as the set of climatic conditions typical of a given small area. Local variations, often influenced by terrain, vegetation, and human activities, form a complex web of microclimates that shape our immediate environment.\nThe study and modeling of microclimates is becoming increasingly important for understanding the complex dynamics of temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and other climate variables at fine spatial scales, especially in urban areas. As the critical importance of regional differences in the context of global climate change becomes more apparent, the need for robust and user-friendly microclimate models is growing.\nMicroclimate modeling is based on the collection and evaluation of physical, statistical, observational, and analytical data. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, with a core of meteorology, climatology, and computer science, but also with large overlaps with, for example, ecology and urban planning.\nIn this course, the microclimate model Envi-met is used to answer typical urban planning questions. The overall goal is to teach the basics of practical application, from data collection and processing to modeling, analysis, and scientific presentation.\nAdvances in sensor technology, including ground-based sensors, drones, and aerial photography, as well as freely available data sets, help to create a realistic and complex modeling base.\nReliable simulation of different planning scenarios requires at least a basic understanding of the most important meteorological processes. As an introduction we refer to the book Practical Meteorology by Roland Stull, especially the chapter Atmospheric Boundary Layer."

    "text": "Background and Method\nThis section explains the theoretical principles of leaf area density (LAD) and describes how it can be determined using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Leaf area density is an important parameter in environmental modeling, for example for radiation balance and microclimate simulations. It indicates the leaf area per volume (m²/m³) and is therefore a decisive factor for microclimate simulations, radiation models, and energy flows in vegetation stands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach Type\nName / Description\nNature\n\n\n\n\nPulse-count based\nSimple linear normalization of return counts or voxel hits\nEmpirical, direct\n\n\nLinear normalization\nStraightforward normalization of pulse counts by voxel volume or max LAD\nEmpirical, basic\n\n\nPulse-density normalization\nAdjusts for occlusion and scan geometry\nSemi-empirical\n\n\nGap fraction models\nEstimate LAD/LAI from canopy openness statistics\nSemi-empirical\n\n\nBeer–Lambert conversion conversion\nUses exponential light attenuation to infer LAD\nPhysically-based\n\n\nVoxel-based inverse modeling\nOptimizes 3D LAD to match observed light attenuation or reflectance\nPhysically-based\n\n\nAllometric / geometric reconstruction\nReconstructs crown volume and distributes LAD using QSM or shape fitting\nGeometric, structural\n\n\n\n\nLinear normalization is a practical baseline: simple, fast, and reproducible.\nBeer–Lambert conversion introduces realism via physical light attenuation.\n\nMore advanced models (e.g. voxel inverse or QSM-based) aim for higher biophysical fidelity at the cost of complexity.\nThe present analysis is based on TLS with a medium-range RIEGL scanner (e.g., VZ-400). This captures millions of 3D points of the vegetation structure with high angular resolution. The point cloud is divided into uniform voxels, from which the leaf area density is estimated in two ways.\n\nLinear normalization (straightforwad)\n\\[\n\\text{LAD}_i = \\frac{N_i}{N_{\\max}} \\cdot \\text{LAD}_{\\max}\n\\] - \\(N_i\\): Number of laser points in voxel \\(i\\)\n- \\(N_{\\max}\\): Maximum across all voxels\n- \\(\\text{LAD}_{\\max}\\): Maximum LAD value from the literature (e.g., 5 m²/m³)\n\n\n\nBeer–Lambert conversion\n\\[\n\\text{LAD}_i = -\\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{N_i}{N_{\\max}}\\right)}{k \\cdot \\Delta z}\n\\]\n\n\\(k\\): Extinction coefficient (typically 0.3–0.5)\n\\(\\Delta z\\): vertical voxel height\n\n\n\nOverall Workflow\nWhat happens in the script?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nRelevant Code\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Implemetation\nTo use this ENVI-met tree modeling workflow in R, follow these steps to load and initialize the project correctly:\nProject Setup: Loading the R Project and Environment\n\nDownload and Unzip the Project Archive\n\nUnzip the folder to your desired location.\nThe folder should contain at least:\n\nAn *.Rproj file (e.g. envimet_tree_workflow.Rproj)\nA data/ folder with input files like tree_08.las\nOne or more R/ scripts\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Project in RStudio\n\nGo to File → Open Project\nSelect the *.Rproj file (e.g. microclimate_TLS.Rproj)\nThis ensures that the project directory is treated as the root for all file paths.\n\n\nThe use of the {here} package depends on having a valid RStudio project. Without this, file paths may not resolve correctly.\n\n\n\nData Input Parameters and Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input data set tree_08.las is a cleaned terrestrial laser scan of a single, isolated tree. All surrounding vegetation and ground points have been removed, so the file contains only the tree’s structure—trunk, branches, and foliage. Stored in standard LAS format, it provides high-resolution 3D point data suitable for voxelization, LAD calculation, or input into microclimate and radiative models. This detailed structural data is essential for generating true 3D tree entities in ENVI-met; without it, only simplified vegetation (SimplePlants) can be used.\n\n\n\nSet global parameters for the workflow, such as file paths, voxel resolution, and maximum LAD value for normalization.\n\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(lidR)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nzmax &lt;- 40  \ngrain.size &lt;- 1  \nproject_root &lt;- here::here()  \n\n# Choose LAD method: \"linear\" or \"beer\"\n# Beer–Lambert conversion Notes:\n# - Avoids log(0) and 1 by clipping near-extreme values\n# - Use when cumulative light absorption or occlusion is relevant\n# - Suitable if extinction coefficient is known or estimated from prior studies\nlad_method &lt;- \"beer\"  # Set to \"linear\" or \"beer\"\n\n# Optional: extinction coefficient (used only for Beer–Lambert conversion)\nk_extinction &lt;- 0.25\n\n\nlas_file &lt;- file.path(project_root, \"data/TLS/tree_08.laz\")  \noutput_voxels &lt;- file.path(project_root, \"data/TLS/LAD_voxDF.rds\")  \noutput_array &lt;- file.path(project_root, \"data/TLS/lad_array_m2m3.rds\")  \noutput_profile_plot &lt;- file.path(project_root, \"data/TLS/lad_vertical_profile.pdf\")  \n\n\n\nVoxelization of TLS data\nVoxelisation turns a 3D TLS point cloud into a grid of cubes (voxels), where each voxel holds structural information. The number of points per voxel is used to estimate Leaf Area Density (LAD), typically normalized relative to the voxel with the most returns.\n\nEach voxel = a 1×1×1 m³ cube\nCount the laser hits per voxel\nNormalize to maximum\nMultiply by a literature-based LAD_max (e.g. 5 m²/m³)\n\nThis gives a spatially distributed LAD profile suitable for further analysis or models like ENVI-met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(terra)\n\n las &lt;- lidR::readLAS(las_file)  # Read the LAS/LAZ file (point cloud data)\n\n\n[=========================&gt;

A raster stack derived from TLS data provides exactly this: each layer represents LAD in a specific height slice, and each XY cell corresponds to one vertical profile. This structure can be exported as CSV, ASCII rasters, or custom profile files.\nFor 3D vegetation parameterization in ENVI-met 5.8+, the raster stack enables preprocessing of spatially explicit LAD or LAI profiles, even if some reformatting is needed.\nThe raster stack also supports canopy clustering and prototyping. It allows classification of structural types, simplification of complex vegetation, and the creation of representative profiles for simulation.\n\nlibrary(terra)\n# In SpatRasterStack umwandeln\nxy &lt;- df_lad[, c(\"X\", \"Y\")]  \nlad_vals &lt;- df_lad[, grep(\"^lad_\", names(df_lad), value = TRUE)]  \n\nlad_raster &lt;- rast(cbind(xy, lad_vals), type = \"xyz\")  \nplot(lad_raster)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a more 3D version it looks like below.\n\n# #| eval: false\n# #| include: false\n# library(terra)\n# library(rgl)\n# \n# # Threshold value for LAD\n# threshold &lt;- 0.1 # change as needed\n# \n# # Step 1: Convert raster to voxel data frame\n# rast_cube &lt;- lad_raster  # your raster stack\n# voxel_df &lt;- as.data.frame(rast_cube, xy = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)\n# names(voxel_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", paste0(\"z\", seq_len(nlyr(rast_cube))))\n# \n# # Step 2: Reshape to long format\n# voxel_long &lt;- reshape(\n#   voxel_df,\n#   direction = \"long\",\n#   varying = paste0(\"z\", seq_len(nlyr(rast_cube))),\n#   v.names = \"val\",\n#   timevar = \"z\",\n#   times = seq_len(nlyr(rast_cube))\n# )\n# \n# # Step 3: Clean up and filter by threshold\n# voxel_long &lt;- voxel_long[!is.na(voxel_long$val) & voxel_long$val &gt; threshold, ]\n# voxel_long$z &lt;- as.numeric(voxel_long$z)\n# \n# # Step 4: Normalize colors\n# colors &lt;- terrain.colors(100)[cut(voxel_long$val, breaks = 100)]\n# \n# # Step 5: Draw voxel cubes\n# open3d(useNULL = TRUE)\n# for (i in seq_len(nrow(voxel_long))) {\n#   shade3d(\n#     translate3d(cube3d(scale = 1), \n#                 voxel_long$x[i], \n#                 voxel_long$y[i], \n#                 voxel_long$z[i]),\n#     color = colors[i],\n#     alpha = 0.8\n#   )\n# }\n# \n# # Step 6: Render in browser\n# # Determine the bounds of your voxel space\n# xlim &lt;- range(voxel_long$x)\n# ylim &lt;- range(voxel_long$y)\n# zlim &lt;- range(voxel_long$z)\n# \n# # Draw bounding box\n# lines3d(rbind(\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[1], zlim[1]),\n#   c(xlim[2], ylim[1], zlim[1]),\n#   c(xlim[2], ylim[2], zlim[1]),\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[2], zlim[1]),\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[1], zlim[1])\n# ), col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\n# \n# lines3d(rbind(\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[1], zlim[2]),\n#   c(xlim[2], ylim[1], zlim[2]),\n#   c(xlim[2], ylim[2], zlim[2]),\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[2], zlim[2]),\n#   c(xlim[1], ylim[1], zlim[2])\n# ), col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\n# \n# for (i in 1:4) {\n#   lines3d(\n#     rbind(\n#       c(xlim[c(1,2,2,1)][i], ylim[c(1,1,2,2)][i], zlim[1]),\n#       c(xlim[c(1,2,2,1)][i], ylim[c(1,1,2,2)][i], zlim[2])\n#     ), col = \"black\", lwd = 2\n#   )\n# }\n# \n# # Optional: Add coordinate axes\n# axes3d(edges = c(\"x--\", \"y--\", \"z--\"), col = \"gray40\")\n# title3d(xlab = \"X\", ylab = \"Y\", zlab = \"Z\")\n# widget &lt;- rglwidget()\n# htmlwidgets::saveWidget(widget, \"tree_voxel_viewer.html\", selfcontained = TRUE)\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nLAD Profile Visualizations from TLS Data\nThe plot_lad_profiles() function visualizes vertical leaf area density (LAD) profiles derived from voxelized TLS (terrestrial laser scanning) data. LAD represents leaf surface area per unit volume (m²/m³). The function provides three main plot styles:\n\n\n1. XY Matrix Plot (plotstyle = \"each_median\")\n\nDisplays a grid of mini-profiles, each representing a 0.5 × 0.5 m (x/y) ground column.\nWithin each cell, a normalized vertical LAD profile is plotted:\n\nY-axis (height) is normalized from 0 to 1 per column.\nX-axis shows LAD values normalized relative to the global LAD maximum.\n\nUseful for comparing structural patterns across space.\n\n\n\n2. Overall Median Profile (plotstyle = \"all_median\")\n\nAggregates LAD values across all (x/y) locations by height bin.\nProduces a typical vertical profile using the median and smoothed with a moving average.\nHeight is shown in absolute units (e.g. meters).\nCaptures the dominant vertical canopy structure.\n\n\n\n3. Single Profile (plotstyle = \"single_profile\")\n\nExtracts and plots the LAD profile at a specific (x, y) coordinate.\nBoth LAD and height are shown in absolute units.\nPlots the true vertical structure at one location.\n\nThe matrix plot shows multiple vertical LAD profiles arranged in a grid, with each small plot corresponding to a specific spatial location. This allows the vertical vegetation structure to be viewed in relation to its position on the ground. To make the individual profiles comparable, both height and LAD values are normalized within the plot. A reference profile on the side shows the overall median LAD distribution by height, which helps interpret the scale and shape of the individual profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# --- Reshape LAD data to long format ----------------------------------------\n\nlad_df &lt;- as.data.frame(lad_raster, xy = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)     # Convert raster to data.frame\n\n# 1.

For deciduous trees, values usually range between 0.15 and 0.20. 0.18 is a commonly used default for broadleaved species like Fagus sylvatica or Quercus robur in many ecological models (e.g., ENVI-met, MAESPA). It affects surface energy balance and radiation reflection in ENVI-met simulations.\nTransmittance = 0.3: Transmittance represents the proportion of shortwave radiation that passes through the canopy without being absorbed or reflected. Deciduous trees in full leaf have transmittance values between 0.1 and 0.4 depending on species and LAI. 0.3 reflects moderate canopy density, consistent with empirical observations for mid-summer crowns. It controls how much light reaches the ground and sub-canopy vegetation; affects microclimate and shading.\nBoth values can be adjusted to match field measurements or literature for specific species or leaf phenology. However you can use them as robust fallback defaults when exact species traits are unavailable.",

This makes it suitable for large-scale or repeated surveys without the need for time-consuming ground calibration.\nCaptures structural patterns: Normalizing the LAD values retains the vertical and spatial structure of vegetation, enabling meaningful comparison of crown shape, canopy layering, and vegetation density across space or time.\nDirectly usable in ENVI-met: The output is structured as a raster stack with height-specific layers, aligning with the input requirements of ENVI-met’s SimplePlant or 3D vegetation modules.
