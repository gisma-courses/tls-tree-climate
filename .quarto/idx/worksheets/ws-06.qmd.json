In addition, of course, technical knowledge is required, such as how to extract, visualize, and compare the data of interest.\n\nThese two problem areas are interrelated, although they are independent of each other.\n\nIn summary, we need (1) one or more meteorological parameters that describe and quantify the production of fresh air. (2) We have to decide whether we use the area integral over time or a point measurement of these parameters as a proxy variable for our investigation, and then (3) find suitable technical means to carry out these calculations and data extractions. (4) Finally, we have to edit and discuss our hypotheses on this basis.\n\n## Identification of proxy parameters\n\nFirst of all get familar with the boundary layer basic concept of [cold air production see p. 693-705](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/books/Practical_Meteorology/prmet102/Ch18-abl-v102.pdf).\n\nThe simplest approach would be to use a directly calculated variables from the Envi-met simulation runs. Since the supply of fresh air depends on the wind vector and also represents a spatial and temporal integral of the cold air inflow area of Ockershausen, not only the temperature difference is crucial, but also the gravitative/synoptic transport component. However, since the core simulation domain does not cover the entire catchment area, the relative catchment area of the runoff line in the Heiligengrund must serve as a reference point.\n\nTherefore, according to the [avove chapters](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/books/Practical_Meteorology/prmet102/Ch18-abl-v102.pdf), suitable parameters could be:\n\n* Temperature\n* Wind direction / wind speed \n\nThe conceptual realisation of both the meteorological and data-technical implementation could be as follows\n\n* to identify the appropriate existing variables from the [Envi-met parameter](https://envi-met.info/doku.php?id=filereference:output:atmosphere) list\n* to create summary [evaluation maps](https://youtu.be/TdSUzJ94Kgc?si=7LCBHhKg30I3u-PV) of the model runs and their differences\n* to export suitable data layers for further [processing and analysis with QGIS](https://youtu.be/SccwMiCngCs?si=HlaCEl9WyhvCKsib)\n* in QGIS\n  * to calculate the [catchment area](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.html)\n  * to calculate zonal statistics on the catchment area to quantitatively determine the air mass difference.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](../images/mandantory.png){width=\"10%\"}\n\n## Goals\n\nFour model runs were created: 2 for the planned expansion, 2 for the actual state, each with simplified meteorological boundary conditions for a radiation situation with little exchange.
