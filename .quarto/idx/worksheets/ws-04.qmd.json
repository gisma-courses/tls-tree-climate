Consider the following aspects:\n* abiotic endowment of the model domain (relief, soil, site location).\n* biotic features of the model domain (simple/3D vegetation)\n* technical model domain (x,y,z extent, time steps nesting)\n* appropriate meteorology for model initialization (ideal, real values)\n* Validation strategy\n\n\n\n## Hands on \n\nThe preparation of the modelling environment for an Envi_met model run can be as complex as desired, but the following criteria should always be kept in mind:\n\n1. the size and desired resolution of the model domain (depending on the research question AND computing costs)\n2. scientific or planning level of detail of the research question \n4. focus of the modelling (wind field, plant respiration, micrometeorological parameters).\n\nThe input data sources must be selected according to these factors. In hilly terrain, a high resolution digital terrain model or digital surface model is essential. In addition, at least a rough estimate of land use and soil type is required. In addition the three-dimensional structure of the model requires at least good estimates of vegetation and building heights in the selected model area.\n\n\nFor the modeling of cold air drainage (i.e. fresh air production) in the Hasenkopf area, the terrain, land use and meteorologically critical situations are of central importance. If you do not want to collect all the data in the field manually (which may be a sensible approach), Open Street Map data and aerial images are particularly useful for land use and possible follow-up surveys. Terrain data is now available in high resolution in the 1m range for large parts of Europe and the world. This data must be downloaded and prepared accordingly (for the Envi_met logic). There is now a powerful and largely functional plugin for QGIS 'Geodata to Envi_met', which intuitively specifies how this data is to be organized.\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nFor the above question of cold air production, the freely available data from the State of Hesse and the Hessian Administration for Land Management and Geoinformation, as well as the Openstreetmap data, are well suited.

Create a new field with 6 alphanumeric characters and the name `ENVIMET_ID`. Then process the following expression. This assigns the corresponding vegetation database identifier to the new ‘ENVIMET_ID’ field.\n\n\n``` \nCASE \nCASE \n  WHEN \"landuse\" =   'grass'       THEN '000000'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'meadow'        THEN '000000'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmyard'      THEN '0201H4'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'forest'        THEN '0000SM'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'allotments'    THEN '0201H4'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'orchard'       THEN '000051'\n  WHEN \"natural\" =   'grassland'     THEN '000000'\t\n  WHEN \"natural\" =   'wood'          THEN '0000SM'\n\tWHEN \"natural\" =   'scrub'         THEN '0100H2'  \n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmland'      THEN '02AGSS'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'residental'    THEN '02AGSS'\t\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'industrial'    THEN '0200AK'\t\n    ELSE '000000'\nEND\n```\n\n![](../images/field_calc.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n\nSave the file.\n\nOn the same file, we need to edit the non-vegetated surfaces in a corresponding way:\n\n```\nCASE \n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'farmland'      THEN '02AGSS'\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'residental'    THEN '02AGSS'\t\n\tWHEN \"landuse\" =   'industrial'    THEN '0200AK'\n  ELSE '0200AK'\n```\n\nPress `Select Objects` Button and Export selected Values only (do not forget to assign the correct projection EPSG:32632) and name it  `polygons_surfaces.gpkg`.\n\n\n### Line surface types\n\nWe need polygon data for the spatial setup of the envimet model domain. Line data is one-dimensional, so a simple approach is to buffer roads according to their priority.  Therefore we buffer the different road types with 8m (primary), 5m (secondary), 4m (tertiary) and 2.5m (tracks).\n\nThen process the following expression to assign the `ENVIMET_IDs`:\n\n```\n\nCASE \n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'primary'        THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'primary_link'   THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'secondary'      THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'secondary_link' THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'tertiary'       THEN '0200AK'\n  WHEN \"highway\" =   'tertiary_link'  THEN '0200AK'  \n  WHEN \"surface\" =   'asphalt'        THEN '0200AK'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'ground'         THEN '0200TS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'dirt'           THEN '0200TS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'mud'            THEN '0200TS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'fine_gravel'    THEN '0200BS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'gravel'         THEN '0200BS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'grass'          THEN '02AGSS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'unpaved'        THEN '0200TS'\n\tWHEN \"surface\" =   'compacted'      THEN '0200BS'\nELSE '0200TS'\nEND\n```\n\nSave the file as `line_surfaces.gpgk`. \n\nNext merge `polygons_surfaces.gpkg` and `line_surface.gpgk` into `all_surfaces.gpgk`.\n\n\n## Buildings \n\nUse the OSM polygon data again and select all buildings that do not have the value NULL. \n\n```\n \"building\" is not NULL\n```\n\nSave the file as `buildings.gpgk`. \n\nWe need the heights of the buildings, so we extract the data from the surface height model (SHM) for each building using the `zonal statistics` tool, which we previously calculated using the raster computer from the difference between the digital surface model (DSM) and the digital elevation model (DEM).\n\n\n\n## Check for missing data\n\nHide all data and activate only the generated vegetation, surface and building data. \nCheck in the following order:\n\n1. is there still surface data without information?\n2. are there vegetation areas without information?\n3. are all buildings present?\n\n* Regarding 1: It is likely that important information is missing, especially for the surfaces. All streets and sealed surfaces should be present here, but the surfaces under vegetation, etc. have no information. The easiest way is to assign a soil type code to this total area. This is most easily done by calculating a symmetric difference between the surface data and the model area; the resulting polygon is a negative of the existing surfaces. This polygon is then assigned a field 'ENVIMET_ID' and the corresponding soil value is entered. The file is then merged with the existing surface file (merge tool).\n* Regarding 2: If areas are unclear, they must be digitized [manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/create_new_vector.html). To do this, open the Bing/Google aerial map and open the corresponding vegetation file, make it editable and re-digitize it. It is important that the correct ENVIMET_ID is assigned at the end of each polygon.\n* Regarding 3: Simply compare the aerial image to see if all buildings are present in the model area. If not, digitize them again and then use the zonal statistics tool again. \n\n## Receptors\n\nSo-called receptors can be set up to compare and locally measure continuous values. These work like complex measuring stations in the terrain. \nTo do this, we use the tool [`Vector->Research Tools->Regular Points`] (https://youtu.be/ExgfFEEgeWA?si=nZWgiZR299VQBAR1).\nWe can, for example, create a point every 100 meters. Points at the edge, in buildings, etc. can then be deleted manually, as they require a considerable amount of additional computing time during the simulation. There should not be many more than 50-60 points...\nSave the file as `receptors.gpkg`.\n\n\n## Planning data\n\nPlanning data is required to compare the production of fresh air between the actual and planned conditions. The available data can be found in the presentation linked above. We use the following screenshot to record the changes in land use, buildings and vegetation based on this.\nTo do this, the map presentation image must be georeferenced. This is done using the tool [`Layer->Georeferencer`](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html).\n\nThe basic approach is to find points (so-called ground control points) in the draft plan that can also be identified in the Bing aerial photograph, for example. Using these points, the image is integrated into the geometry of the GIS data and can then be digitized accordingly.\n\n![](../images/georef.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\nThe basic approach is to find points (so-called ground control points) in the draft plan that can also be identified in the Bing aerial photograph, for example. On the basis of these points, the image is integrated into the geometry of the GIS data and can then be digitized accordingly.\n\n\nAfter the georeferencing has been successfully carried out, the deviating structures are now integrated into copies of the respective inventory files by manual digitization. The number of floors is indicated for the buildings and can be adopted with a height of 3 m each. The trees were digitized as 3D plant points and assigned to different standard heights of a standard deciduous tree species, depending on their diameter. Paths are recorded as paved.\n\n![](../images/planning.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n\nSave the files under a unique name in each case, making it clear that the planning layers are meant.\n\n## Convert Geodata to envimet\n\nYou can now run the [`Convert Geodata to Envimet`](https://youtu.be/FgW1_PRPMWo?si=vgx3kY3uGR7-T995)] plug-in.

These work like complex measuring stations in the terrain. \nTo do this, we use the tool [`Vector->Research Tools->Regular Points`] (https://youtu.be/ExgfFEEgeWA?si=nZWgiZR299VQBAR1).\nWe can, for example, create a point every 100 meters. Points at the edge, in buildings, etc. can then be deleted manually, as they require a considerable amount of additional computing time during the simulation. There should not be many more than 50-60 points...\nSave the file as `receptors.gpkg`.\n\n\n## Planning data\n\nPlanning data is required to compare the production of fresh air between the actual and planned conditions. The available data can be found in the presentation linked above. We use the following screenshot to record the changes in land use, buildings and vegetation based on this.\nTo do this, the map presentation image must be georeferenced. This is done using the tool [`Layer->Georeferencer`](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html).\n\nThe basic approach is to find points (so-called ground control points) in the draft plan that can also be identified in the Bing aerial photograph, for example. Using these points, the image is integrated into the geometry of the GIS data and can then be digitized accordingly.\n\n![](../images/georef.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\nThe basic approach is to find points (so-called ground control points) in the draft plan that can also be identified in the Bing aerial photograph, for example. On the basis of these points, the image is integrated into the geometry of the GIS data and can then be digitized accordingly.\n\n\nAfter the georeferencing has been successfully carried out, the deviating structures are now integrated into copies of the respective inventory files by manual digitization. The number of floors is indicated for the buildings and can be adopted with a height of 3 m each. The trees were digitized as 3D plant points and assigned to different standard heights of a standard deciduous tree species, depending on their diameter. Paths are recorded as paved.\n\n![](../images/planning.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n\nSave the files under a unique name in each case, making it clear that the planning layers are meant.\n\n## Convert Geodata to envimet\n\nYou can now run the [`Convert Geodata to Envimet`](https://youtu.be/FgW1_PRPMWo?si=vgx3kY3uGR7-T995)] plug-in. Of course, two different models have to be generated: one for the actual state and one for the planned state.\n\n## Help\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nAll files, GCP and the model files
